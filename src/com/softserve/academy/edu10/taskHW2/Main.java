//2. Create a class called Student which includes the following fields: name, group, course, and grades in
//different subjects. Create a collection that holds all objects. Write a methods that:
//o removes students with a grade point average of less than 3. If a student's average score is 3 or
//higher, then they will be automatically promoted to the next course level.
//o printStudents(List<Student> students, int course) which takes a list of students and a course
//number as inputs. This method should print out the names of the students who are enrolled in the
//specified course number to the console.
//â€¢ In main() method create collection and output result.
