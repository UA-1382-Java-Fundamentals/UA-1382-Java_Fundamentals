### Instructions 🛠️

#### How to create a new branch:

1. Create a folder on your local drive 📂
2. Open Command Prompt, Git Bash, or the **terminal** in your IDE (IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse) 💻
3. Clone the repository 🔗:
    ```bash
   https://github.com/UA-1382-Java-Fundamentals/UA-1382-Java_Fundamentals.git
    ```
4. Navigate to your directory:
    ```bash
    cd UA-1382
    ```
5. Check the active branch:
    ```bash
    git branch
    ```
6. Create your own branch:
    ```bash
    git branch nameBranch
    ```
7. Switch to the new branch:
    ```bash
    git checkout nameBranch
    ```
8. Open the project in your IDE (IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse) and start writing code.
